    # <something> = q_func(obs_t_float, num_actions, scope="q_func", reuse=False)

    # q_func_vars = tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES, scope='q_func')
    # Older versions of TensorFlow may require using "VARIABLES" instead of "GLOBAL_VARIABLES"

        # observation and its outcome (reward, next observation, etc.) into

        # encode_recent_observation that will take the latest observation
        # that you pushed into the buffer and compute the corresponding
        # input that should be given to a Q network by appending some

            # next observations, and done indicator).
            # 3.b: initialize the model if it has not been initialized yet; to do
            # that, call
            #    initialize_interdependent_variables(session, tf.global_variables(), {

            # the current and next time step. The boolean variable model_initialized
            # indicates whether or not the model has been initialized.
            # Remember that you have to update the target network too (see 3.d)!
            # 3.c: train the model. To do this, you'll need to use the train_fn and
            # total_error ops that were created earlier: total_error is what you
            # created to compute the total Bellman error in a batch, and train_fn
            # will actually perform a gradient step and update the network parameters
            # to reduce total_error. When calling session.run on these you'll need to

            # obs_t_ph
            # act_t_ph
            # rew_t_ph
            # obs_tp1_ph
            # done_mask_ph
            # (this is needed for computing total_error)
            # learning_rate -- you can get this from optimizer_spec.lr_schedule.value(t)
            # (this is needed by the optimizer to choose the learning rate)
            # 3.d: periodically update the target network by calling
            # session.run(update_target_fn)
            # you should update every target_update_freq steps, and you may find the
            # variable num_param_updates useful for this (it was initialized to 0)
